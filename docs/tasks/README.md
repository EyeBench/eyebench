# Tasks

EyeBench v1.0 spans seven predictive tasks that fall into two categories:

- **Reader properties** — infer stable attributes of the reader such as general comprehension skill, vocabulary knowledge, dyslexia, or domain expertise.
- **Reader–text interactions** — predict how well a reader engages with a specific text, including comprehension accuracy, claim verification, and subjective difficulty.

Select a task from the navigation to explore its supported datasets and label definitions.
