# Reading Comprehension

**Prediction target**: binary label indicating whether the reader answered a passage-specific question correctly

**Task type**: classification over reader–text interactions

## Supported datasets

- [OneStop (Ordinary Reading)](/datasets/onestop)
- [SB-SAT](/datasets/sbsat)
- [PoTeC](/datasets/potec)

This task focuses on text-specific understanding. Each sample links a reader's scanpath over a passage with the
subsequent comprehension question and response, enabling models to infer success directly from eye movements.
