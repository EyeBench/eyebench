**Task type**: classification over reader properties

## Supported datasets

Domain Expertise is newly introduced in EyeBench. After each article, readers answer three background-knowledge
questions. Their aggregate performance defines the expertise label, challenging models to recover prior knowledge
from in-text gaze behavior alone.
